Writing Challenge:

Write 10 five papragraph esays blind in 100  minutes.

setting watch... GO

The first thing I want to write about is the fact that it is really easy to bang out o few af these bad boys straight away.

Already, I have a hook. This paragraph is meant to capture the attention of the reader. The sentences in this paragraph are short, wheras, the other pragrahp was just one longer sencetec.

It is time to move on to the third paragraph. This is teh middle of teh work. We will keep in brief for the sake of this essay. This is where you sometmies make the negative of your thesis.

Speaknig of a Thesis, I forget to mention. The Thesis in the most important sentince in your work. English teachers often incorrectly tell their students to place the thesis in the first paragraph. While th first parapraph is a fine place for a thesis, there are plenty of other places that a thesis can go. For instance, this sentece is the thesis to this essay.

Bottom line: Writing essays is easy. TL;DR Writing essays is easy if you stick to five paragraphs.

Next Essay.

In order to bang through these essays, I must decid to do some free writing here.

This is important to keep the  fingers woarm as I cthink about another thing to talk about.

================================================================================
BEGIN
================================================================================

For 29 years I have been told that my father grew up poor, and that my mother was French. 28 hours ago I just realized that my father does not have "poor" blood in his veins, he has German blood in his veins.

My Father's Father was given the first name Gerald by his father. Gerald's Grandfather fought for the Germans in The Great War (which was later named World War 1). After that, the whole family decided to get the F out of there when the impending doom of the Nazis was inevetable.

Of course, they sailed to America, where Gear'ld Father met his Mother and gave birth to him. He later gave birth to two children, named Linda and Jerry subsecquently.

I still have not talked about my grandmother's role in any of this mostly because I am unsure of her blood. I would be willing to bet it is some part German and Russian.

As a closing remark I want to say that all of this is a linguistic point and not a historical one. I am able to trace my heritage through the names me and my family have been givien. I know quite a lot about my Mother's side of the family (being the Chauviere's) but not about my Fathers. I still think it is fascinating none-the-less.

Considering next topic ... Python and R

================================================================================
Begin
================================================================================

The first thing to talk about with any programing language is it's syntax. Python is

    1. White Space Sensitive
    2. Human readable/Crpytic Hybrid
    3. Order Agnostic
    4. Functional/Iterative/OOP
    5. Intutive & Unlockable

The next thing to talk about with any programming language is it's user base. Python is used for (in no particular order)

    - Security/Encryption
    - Business Oriented Projects
    - Data Science
    - Music/Art/Fractal/Mathamatical related projects
    - Pretty much anything you want really. The wrold is your Oyster

The final thing to talk about with any language is the downsides. Python is

    - Duck Typed
    - A little bloated with too much agnostic functioality.
    - Sometimes too hybrid between low and high level.
    - Too easy to hang yourself with.

The last thing that I want to say is that Python is a really great language to learn right now. Schools should be teaching it. Businesses should be using it. It is a great language as long as the programmer is conscientious about everything that happens.

I am that level of orderly right now so I beileve it is time I put on my big boy panties and worked on some python.

Quick moment ... Data Manipulation

================================================================================
BEGIN
================================================================================

Data is an array of alphabet symbols (bits/letters/syllables/etcetara) arranged in a uniform manner.

There is of course much more to say about Data and Data Manipulation Sysetms (DMS not to be confused with DBMS) but for the moment it suffices to say that "uniform" can mean myriad things.

The most obvious meaning given to "uniform" is "exact" but this is not quite correct. If something is exact it is uniform. The converse statemnent is false.

'uniform' simply means applying some algorithm to the rows in a database to extract out the column information.

The easiest way to do this would be to have the columns lined up. A much more elegant way to do this would be to create a compact pattern with unpacking algorithm which elegently and gracefully unfolds the records before your eyes.

There is much more to say about how to do that specifically, but that will have to be put towards another essay.

This is another essay meant to emphasize the ease of which one can write essayses.

I don',t have to concern myself with the words I write in this one. Fo course, I am concenred about maintaining lucid clarity throughtout the whole piece. I donn't want ot get caught in a thought loop thought.

Let's start another thought loop. So today I visited Daniel and Jesse, and they told me I was too aggressive. At the moment, anyone that tells me I am too aggressive will get firewalled from my life.

So this essay got derailed. Perhaps the next essay needs to be about thought loops.

Okay, On to the next one

In a meditation practice, there is usually some connection to the breath that everyone will take.

In Vipassina the focus is on maintaining this sort of focus for a long amount of ctime. Many Vipassina retreats are minimuem ten tdays, and others and 30 days all the way to 80 and beyond even in some cases.

The purpose of these retreats is to connect to the breath is a deep and fundamental way.

Of course, I believe there are other ways to connect to the breath. For instance, it is possible to practice meditation regularly, and then your meditation practice will extend in to everything else that you do in life.

It is important to maintain proper meditaiton habits, because those things will be what last you for a life time.

Drafting is an art that must be learned.

3 3 3 From there, with everything layed out, draw the prototype. Mesaure the sides, draw it from angles, Get it on paper.

4 4 4 4 When those papers have been distilled to the ones that represent the full descencet into the underwaord having emerged with the golden plans for the next draft, implement that next draft.

Repeat steps 3 and 4 in whatever order until the project is completed and reproducable.
